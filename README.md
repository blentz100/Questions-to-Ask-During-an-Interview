# Questions-to-Ask-During-an-Interview



Is there someone already doing this role or is it a new role?

Where would you like to see this company in 5 years?

Who do you consider your closest competitors? (You should research this question in advance)

What do you value most?

What would make you feel like you had a successful hire into this role?

Why did you get into this field?

What keeps you up at night?

Are there any leadership books, podcasts, authors you love?

Are there any questions I haven’t asked that I should ask?

Is there any more information I can share with you that would convince you that I’m the best person for this role?



Add about 10 more questions specific to the company itself. Come up with your questions by researching them on google news, social media, glassdoor, podcasts, crunchbase, their own careers page, LinkedIn, etc.

After the interview, instead of sending a thank you note, send a note summarizing your understanding of the answer to all these questions. 
Ask the interiewer to confirm that you heard the answers correctly and then restate that you are still interested in the role and give one or 
two more reasons why you think you are a great fit for the role.
